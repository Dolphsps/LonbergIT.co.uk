Went in to IT in 1997 after picking up a bonus job to look after the first 2 PCs for my small Hospitality Consultancy and writing a Customer Database in Access 2.0.
Spent formative IT years with EDS on the Xerox account doing various technical support roles before moving in to a platform management role with Nordea Bank in Copenhagen.  
Returned to the UK in 2002 and rejoined EDS on the DWP account in a roving project troubleshooting role before starting out on my own as in 2005.  
Have worked with multiple financial services clients &#8211; HBOS, Barclays, Tesco Bank, Standard Life, Lloyds and RBS and also ran an Infrastructure centralisation programme for Unilever across the Nordics, Poland &amp; Baltics, Spain, Greece &amp; Cyprus.  
  
Makes a mean Bloody Mary.
