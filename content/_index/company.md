# Cloud Consulting

### "Cloud is the new Normal"
### "Cloud is now more secure than your own data centre"

<br>

##### You will have heard the soundbites but that doesn't mean adopting 'The Cloud' is easy

Taking the journey from running your own data centres to adopting not only the hosting of services in the cloud (ie in somebody else's data centre) but also considering adopting a whole new way of delivering IT Services is not an easy one.

You may see or have heard about some of the benefits...  
* Platforms that automatically scale to the right size at the right time.  No more spending weeks and months working out how much capacity you will need in 3-5 years time.  
* No data centre to own and manage.  
* Infrastructure that is available in minutes rather than weeks



...but then you may struggle with some of the implications...  
* Is your application landscape even suitable for the Cloud?  
* Could you control the costs?  
* Would you know what all those services, servers and databases are actually used for?  
* Would you seriously consider letting your developers be in charge of spinning up their own infrastructure?  

We have helped several large companies taking the first steps in to the cloud with projects ranging from setting up the technical delivery model and the financial consumption model to working with Enterprise risk functions, legal and compliance teams to provide guidance on how to prepare the enterprise for the IT Revolution of the decade.
